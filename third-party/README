By default, restraint is dynamically linked against system-wide libraries. 
However if you are targetting an older operating system which lacks the 
necessary libraries, or if you want to reduce runtime dependencies, restraint 
can be statically linked against bundled copies of the libraries.

First, use the Makefile in this third-party directory to compile the needed 
static libraries. They will be installed under third-party/tree.

Then, you can build restraint against these static libraries:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=third-party/tree/lib/pkgconfig make STATIC=1

When running tests, you should also pass the path to the gtester binary:

    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=third-party/tree/lib/pkgconfig \
    GTESTER=third-party/tree/bin/gtester make check
