Developer Guide
===============

If you have questions related to Restraint's development that are not
currently answered in this guide, the two main ways to contact the
Restraint development team are the same as those for getting
general assistance with using and installing Beaker:

- the `development mailing list <https://lists.fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/beaker-devel>`__
- the #beaker IRC channel on FreeNode

This document focuses on the mechanics of working with Restraint's
code base with the target audience being a Restraint user interested
in learning more about Restraint's working or a potential Restraint
contributor.

Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restraint is written in C. The source lives in a git repo on
http://git.beaker-project.org along with other related projects. Let's
create a local clone of the Restraint source::

    $ git clone git://git.beaker-project.org/restraint

Restraint uses a number of external libraries/tools, so before you can
build Restraint you need to install the external libraries using
``yum-builddep restraint.spec``. Once you have installed these dependencies,
running a ``make`` at the source directory root will compile and build
Restraint. To also run a quick sanity check, it is a good idea to run
the unit tests using ``make check``. The unit tests use a simple Python HTTP
server and ``git-daemon``, so you will need to install this as well
(``yum -y install git-daemon``).

Testing Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have fixed an existing bug or implemented a new feature, it is
a good idea to add a relevant test. The existing tests can be found in
the ``src/`` directory in the source files with names starting with
``test_``.

It may also be a good idea to run a recipe by building the Restraint
daemon and client from the modified code base. Once you have built the
binaries using ``make``, run ``make install`` to install the Restraint
daemon, client and other bits. Start the Restraint daemon in one
terminal (as ``root`` user)::

    # restraintd
    Waiting for client!

From another terminal, use the Restraint client to execute a recipe::

    # restraint --host 1=127.0.0.1:8081 --job path/to/recipe

More details can be found in :ref:`standalone`.

Submitting a Patch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patches must first be submitted for review to the Beaker project's
``gerrit`` code review installation. It may be convenient to setup a
git remote as follows::

    [remote "restraint-gerrit"]
    url=git+ssh://gerrit.beaker-project.org:29418/restraint

Once youâ€™re happy with the change and the test you have written for
it, push your local branch to Gerrit for review::

    git push restraint-gerrit myfeature:refs/for/master
