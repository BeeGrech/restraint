Release Notes
=============

Restraint 0.1.40
----------------

Released 4 September 2019.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1609330`: Restraint should have a log similar to
    beah's /mnt/testarea/current.log.  This file points to unique
    task file named /tmp/tmp.XXXX (where XXXX is random).  As tasks
    change, the link changes to new tmp.XXXX file.  File
    current.log makes it convenient to find current task log file
    as the job is running.

* | NEW: :bug:`1713313`: Provide an option for not rebooting the
    test box after localwatchdog killed a task. No new code was
    written for this since an option already existed.  This
    changeset documents the option `RSTRNT_DISABLED` which allows
    the user to disable specified plugins.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1678549`: Restraint starts too early for the system
    to get ready for testing.  Instead, wait until network is up
    before starting restraint.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1694221`: SELinux tests break. The `20_unconfined` plugin
    currently checks if process running with SELinux role and domain but
    was missing check if user is SELinux user.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1478653`: [RESTRAINT] Error uploading
    /var/log/messages. Seeing error Bad Request [soup_http_error_quark, 400].
    This error occurs because restraint reports the number of bytes to send
    but then sends more as the file continues to grow.  Now we only send the
    number of bytes from the point the transmission began and ignore
    subsequent lines in the log as they are just extra noise.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1700886`: Restraint not uploading resultoutputfile.log
    when local watchdog expires. The variable OUTPUTFILE was not
    being set.  It is now set to the tasks current.log (ref: 1609330) so
    it is now reported.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1730617`: Multihost: Task execution synchronization
    does not work in restraint. As documented in Beaker's Multihost Tasks
    section, Task 1 on both server and client must complete before moving
    on to Task 2 and so on.  A new plugin `85_sync_multihost_tasks` was
    added to cause synchronization between client and server tasks.

* | FIXED: :bug:`1700915`: Resolve inconsistency of MAXTIME vs MAX_TIME
    variables.  To resolve confusion, `RSTRNT_MAX_TIME` is being deprecated
    with an existing variable `KILLTIMEOVERRIDE`. This changeset documents
    this deprecation.
  | (Contributed by Tomas Klohna)
* | NEW: :bug:`1700926`: Allow task to adjust local watchdog.  The command
    rstrnt-adjust-watchdog only affects the external watchdog.  To be
    compatible with beah, this commmand also works for the local watchdog.
  | (Contributed by Carol Bouchard)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1705223`: Incomplete doc in regards to metadata/testinfo.desc.
    This is a spinoff from BZ1120496 but for restraint.  This changeset
    identified and documented variables in metadata and testinfo file.

Restraint 0.1.37
----------------

Released 11 January 2019.

* | NEW: :bug:`1665390`: Added feature to set family from client XML.
  | (Contributed by Bill Peck)
* | NEW: :bug:`1656466`: Restraint now supports ``@module`` syntax for
    dependencies for RHEL8+.
  | (Contributed by Martin Styk)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1663125`: Restraint now listens separately for IPv4 and IPv6. One
    running version of the protocol is sufficient for ``restraintd`` run.
  | (Contributed by Bill Peck)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1663825`: When BootCurrent is not available, Restraint will
    try to fall back to :file:`/root/EFI_BOOT_ENTRY.TXT`.
  | (Contributed by Martin Styk)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1659353`: Fixed obsolete URL for Bzip2 package in Makefile.
  | (Contributed by Martin Styk)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1599550`: Fixed crash of Restraint for RHEL6 arch s390 caused
    by glib2.
  | (Contributed by Matt Tyson)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1608262`: Fixed guest-host synchronization.

Restraint 0.1.36
----------------

Released 24 August 2018.

* | NEW: :bug:`1506064`: The dmesg error checking plugin can now match patterns
    against multi-line "cut here" style traces. The plugin now ignores a warning
    about "mapping multiple BARs" on IBM x3250m4 systems, matching the existing
    behaviour of the RHTS dmesg checker.
  | (Contributed by Jacob McKenzie)

* | FIXED: :bug:`1592376`: Restraint resets the SIGPIPE handler before executing
    task processes. Previously the tasks would inherit the "ignore" action for
    SIGPIPE from the Restraint parent process, which would prevent normal shell
    broken pipe handling from working correctly in the task.
  | (Contributed by Matt Tyson)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1595167`: When the local watchdog timer expires, Restraint will
    now upload the output from :program:`journalctl` in favour of
    :file:`/var/log/messages` if the systemd journal is present. Previously it
    would attempt to upload :file:`/var/log/messages` even if the file did not
    exist, causing the local watchdog handling to enter an infinite loop.
  | (Contributed by Matt Tyson)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1593595`: Fixed an improper buffer allocation which could cause
    Restraint to crash with a segmentation fault instead of reporting an error
    message in certain circumstances.
  | (Contributed by RÃ³man Joost)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1600825`: Fixed a file conflict introduced in Restraint 0.1.35
    between the ``restraint`` package and the ``rhts-test-env`` package.
  | (Contributed by Matt Tyson)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1601705`: Fixed a shell syntax error in the RPM %post scriptlet
    on RHEL4 which caused the package to be un-installable.
  | (Contributed by Dan Callaghan)
* | FIXED: :bug:`1585904`: Fixed a shell syntax error in the restraintd init
    script which caused it to fail to start on RHEL4.
